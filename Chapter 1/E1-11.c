// How to test the word count program.
/*
    We can do some simple unit tests.
    We can also use the printf function to output the
    words as they are being count.
    Or the hard way, entering random characters and
    visually counting the words.
*/

// Buggy inputs.
/*
    Entering just tabs, blanks, newlines, or nothing.
    At this stage, the program does not recognize words
    just by letters, it will still count symbols as words.
    If we can, input special characters that are neither
    letters or symbols.
